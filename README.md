# About POISED dataset
POISED dataset (Chinthrajah et al., 2019)) includes 30 CyTOF samples from human PBMCs of peanut-allergic individuals, for testing or benchmarking the CyAnno algorithm.

# Dataset design
The dataset consists of 30 CyTOF samples with a panel of 39 marker (21 lineage + 18 functional markers), in which 15 samples were peanut stimulated and 15 samples were untreated. These samples were processed across 7 batches and 21 cell types were manually gated (including closely related cell types as well as non-canonical rare cell types).The non-canonical peanut reactive T cells used in this study were CD69+ CD40L+ CD4+ T cells and CD69+ CD8+ T cells (Neeland et al., 2020).

# Data availability
Raw unlabeled POISED dataset files in FCS 3.0 format and normalized labelled CSV format can be obtained from [FlowRepository](https://flowrepository.org/) (FR-FCM-Z2V9; temporarily restricted for public access). The unnormalized FCS files for unlabelled live cells and manually gated cell types from corresponding samples can also be obtained from this link for reviewers.
