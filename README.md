# About POISED dataset
POISED dataset (Chinthrajah et al., 2019)) includes 30 CyTOF samples from human PBMCs of peanut-allergic individuals, for testing or benchmarking the CyAnno algorithm. These samples were run across 7 batches with a panel of 21 lineage markers and 18 functional markers (Table S1) and under two different stimulations, i.e., unstimulated and peanut stimulated. 21 cell types were manually gated (including closely related cell types). The non-canonical peanut reactive T cells used in this study were CD69+ CD40L+ CD4+ T cells and CD69+ CD8+ T cells (Neeland et al., 2020).
